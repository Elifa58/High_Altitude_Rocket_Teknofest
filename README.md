# Sigma_High_Altitude_Rocket_Teknofest_Trial
I designed this card for the Teknofest high altitude rocket competition that I participated in 2023. This card is the flight control card of our high altitude rocket. While I used the stm32f407 as the processor in the card I designed, I used various sensors for requirements such as pressure, gyro, gps and telemetry with different protocols. I used an SD card to store the data from the sensors and a USB connector to provide data transfer. The main purpose of the card was to ensure the recovery of the rocket in line with the data from these sensors. This is one of the first attempts of the designs I made for the card to be used in this rocket.
